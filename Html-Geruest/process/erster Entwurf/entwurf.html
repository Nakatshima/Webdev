<p> I am the key to the lock in your house
        That keeps your toys in the basement
        And if you get too far inside
        You'll only see my reflection
        It's always best when the light is off
        I am the pick in the ice
        Do not cry out or hit the alarm
        You know we're friends till we die
        And either way you turn
        I'll be there
        Open up your skull
        I'll be there
        Climbing up the walls
        It's always best when the light is off
        It's always better on the outside
        Fifteen blows to the back of your head
        Fifteen blows to your mind
        So lock the kids up safe tonight
        Shut the eyes in the cupboard
        I've got the smell of a local man
        Who's got the loneliest feeling
        That either way he turns
        I'll be there
        Open up your skull
        I'll be there
        Climbing up the walls
        Climbing up the walls
        Climbing up the walls
    </p>
